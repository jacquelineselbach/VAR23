This README document provides an overview and instructions for setting up and running the stack game, 
an interactive 3D game developed using Three.js for 3D rendering and Cannon-es for physics simulation. 
The game incorporates features like dynamic lighting, background color changes based on the system theme 
and animated 3D birds for an immersive gaming experience. It is heavily inspired by "Blocks" for Android or iOS.

Features

- 3D cube stacking gameplay.
- Robotic alignment for automated cube stacking.
- Dynamic background color based on system theme.
- Score and high score tracking.
- Animated 3D birds (parrot, flamingo, and stork) that move around the scene.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Physics simulation using Cannon-es.
- Event handlers for game controls.
